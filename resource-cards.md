You can get inspiration to get started with PlayData with these [cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Jf-HyuaVomNzCEYm89R8vfnGuoGCJ7yqpuK_OiLx7s/edit#slide=id.gccf60d3932_0_46), that show how to create simple projects with PlayData. 

When using the cards, experiment with changing the parameters and adding new blocks to see the effects!

Do not forget to **import data to your project** before creating visualizations. You can use this [earthquake's dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14EOqQbfeSMmmu06tV0S5A6azaNYIRpjvpAcu7Cq6ugU/edit#gid=0) to start playing, if you want.
